# Game Server Features

Here are some important features that may be missing for the game server to function as intended:

- **User Authentication and Management**: Implement character creation, login, and session management to handle player accounts securely.
- **Game State Synchronization**: Ensure that the game state is synchronized across all connected clients, especially during events like combat or item transactions.
- **Event System**: Create a more comprehensive event system to handle various game events (e.g., player actions, NPC interactions) and allow for extensibility.
- **AI for NPCs**: Develop AI behaviors for NPCs to make them more interactive and responsive to player actions.
- **Security Measures**: Add security features to prevent cheating, such as input validation, rate limiting, and secure data transmission.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user interface for players to interact with the game, including inventory management, character stats, and game notifications.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for the server's API, game mechanics, and setup instructions for future developers.

# Additional Features

- **Player Customization**: Allow players to customize their characters (appearance, skills, etc.).
- **Quest System**: Implement a quest system with objectives, rewards, and tracking.
- **Inventory Management**: Enhance inventory management with sorting, filtering, and item descriptions.
- **Skill Trees**: Implement skill trees for character progression, allowing players to specialize.
- **Multiplayer Features**: Add support for multiplayer interactions (trading, teaming up).
- **Dynamic Events**: Create dynamic world events that can change the game state (e.g., invasions, festivals).
- **NPC Interactions**: Enhance NPC interactions with dialogue trees and relationship systems.
- **Crafting System**: Introduce a crafting system for players to create items from resources.
- **Achievements and Leaderboards**: Implement achievements and leaderboards to encourage competition.

- **Server Management Tools**: Develop tools for server administrators to manage player data, events, and game settings.
- **Backup and Restore**: Implement a backup system to restore game data in case of server crashes.
- **Security**: Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the server and player data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize server performance to handle a large number of players and events.
