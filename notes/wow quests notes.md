In *World of Warcraft* (WoW), quests are one of the primary ways players interact with the game's world, progress their characters, and experience its vast lore. Quests provide experience points (XP), gear, gold, reputation, and other rewards, making them essential for leveling up and character development. WoW quests come in various types and complexities, ranging from simple tasks to elaborate story-driven campaigns.

### Types of Quests in World of Warcraft

1. **Main Story Quests (Campaign Quests)**:
   - These quests drive the main narrative of the game, especially in expansions. Campaign quests usually involve key lore characters, significant events, and crucial plot points that advance the storyline of Azeroth and beyond.
   - For example, in the *Shadowlands* expansion, players follow the story of the afterlife realms and their key figures like the Winter Queen, the Primus, and Sylvanas Windrunner.

2. **Side Quests**:
   - Side quests are supplementary tasks that provide additional lore, world-building, and rewards. They often focus on local events, characters, or smaller storylines not directly tied to the main campaign.
   - These quests can range from collecting items to defeating specific enemies or helping an NPC with a personal problem.

3. **World Quests**:
   - Introduced in the *Legion* expansion, World Quests are repeatable daily or weekly quests that appear on the world map and offer rewards based on the player's level and item level. They encourage players to explore various zones and engage in a variety of activities like combat, gathering, or even puzzles.
   - They are a primary method for earning reputation, resources, and other rewards in max-level content.

4. **Daily Quests**:
   - These quests can be completed once per day and are often tied to factions or specific areas. They were more prevalent in expansions like *The Burning Crusade* and *Wrath of the Lich King*, where daily quest hubs were a key feature of max-level progression.
   - Daily quests often involve repetitive tasks like killing mobs, gathering items, or completing objectives in certain zones.

5. **Dungeon and Raid Quests**:
   - These quests require players to complete dungeons or raids, often culminating in boss fights or specific objectives within the instance. They usually offer high-quality gear or other significant rewards.

10. **Escort and Event Quests**:
    - These quests require players to escort an NPC to a specific location or participate in timed events. Escort quests are often more challenging, as they require players to protect the NPC from attacks.

Main story quests, often referred to as **Campaign Quests** in *World of Warcraft* (WoW), are the backbone of the game's narrative. These quests take players through key plotlines of the game's expansions, providing context and lore about the world of Azeroth, its inhabitants, and major events.

3. **Phasing and Cinematics**:
