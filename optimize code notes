OPTIMIZE CODE:
Use Named Constants: Replace magic numbers and strings with named constants. This improves readability and maintainability. For example, define constants for paths, statuses, and other repeated values.

Batch Database Operations: When loading or saving data, consider batching operations to minimize the number of I/O calls. For example, load all player data in one call instead of multiple calls for each player.

Use Efficient Data Structures: For collections of items (like players, NPCs, etc.), consider using Sets or Maps for faster lookups and insertions compared to arrays.

Asynchronous Code: Ensure that all async functions are awaited where necessary. Check for unhandled promise rejections.

Avoid Unnecessary Async/Await: If a function does not need to be asynchronous, avoid using async/await to reduce overhead.
Optimize Game Loop: In the game loop, ensure that only necessary updates are performed. For example, only update NPCs or players that have changed state.

Memory Management: Regularly clean up unused objects or references to prevent memory leaks, especially in long-running processes.


MODULES:
Module Existence: Check that all modules being imported actually in the specified paths If a module is missing, it will cause runtime errors.

File Paths: Verify that the paths used in import statements are correct relative to file structure. Adjust paths as necessary.

Import Statements: Ensure all import statements are correctly referencing the paths and modules.

Exporting Functions/Classes: Ensure that all necessary functions or classes are exported from their respective modules.

Export Statements: Use named exports or default exports appropriately for multiple exports in a file.

Static Properties: Ensure that static properties in classes are correctly referenced and that CONFIG is imported correctly and contains the expected structure.

Circular Dependencies: Be cautious of circular dependencies, as they can lead to unexpected behavior.

Testing Imports: Add simple console logs in each module to they are being loaded correctly.


CLIENT:
Debounce or Throttle Events: For frequently triggered events (like combat actions), implement debouncing or throttling to limit how often they can be processed.
