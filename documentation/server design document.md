# MUD Game Server Design Document

This document provides a detailed and comprehensive framework for developing a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game server. It outlines the architecture, core components, key features of the server implementation, server management, various aspects of game development, and best practices for creating a robust and scalable gaming platform.

## I. Technology Stack and Core Server System Requirements

### 1. Core Server System
- Node.js as the runtime environment
  - Leverage asynchronous I/O and event-driven architecture
  - Use the latest LTS version for stability and performance
- Express.js for HTTP(S) server and routing
  - Implement RESTful API endpoints for non-real-time communication
  - Use middleware for request processing, authentication, and error handling
- Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional event-based communication
  - Implement custom events for game-specific actions
  - Use chat channels for efficient broadcasting to subsets of connected clients

### 2. Configuration
- External configuration file (`config.js`) for easy management of server settings
  - Includes server host, port, SSL paths, log settings, file paths, and game-specific parameters

### 3. Security
- HTTPS support for encrypted connections
  - Implement HTTPS for security
- Fallback to HTTP when HTTPS is not available
  - Provide clear warnings to users about unsecured connections
- SSL/TLS certificate management
  - Use Let's Encrypt for free, automated certificate renewal
  - Implement proper certificate rotation and monitoring

### 4. Networking
- Client connection management
  - Implement connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
  - Handle reconnection attempts gracefully
- Event dispatching
  - Create a robust event system for game actions and updates
  - Implement event queuing for handling high-load situations

### 5. Scalability and Performance
- Asynchronous I/O operations leveraging Node.js event loop
  - Use async/await for clean asynchronous code
  - Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations
- Efficient handling of concurrent connections
  - Implement connection limits and timeout mechanisms
  - Use worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks

### 6. Extensibility
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new features
  - Use dependency injection for loose coupling between modules
- Event-driven design for flexible game mechanics implementation
  - Create a robust event emitter system
  - Allow for dynamic register and deregister of event listeners

## II. Log System

The Log System provides robust logging functionality for the game server. It implements a Singleton pattern to ensure a single, globally accessible logging instance.

### 1. Key Features:
- Singleton pattern implementation for global access
- Configurable log levels with color-coded output
- Conditional logging based on severity thresholds
- File logging with rotation based on file size

### 2. Log Levels:
The system supports four log levels, each associated with a numeric value:
- 'DEBUG': 0
- 'INFO': 1
- 'WARN': 2
- 'ERROR': 3

### 3. Color-Coded Output:
The system uses color-coded output for enhanced readability:
- DEBUG: Orange
- INFO: Default console color
- WARN: Magenta
- ERROR: Red

### 4. Implementation Details:
- Utilizes the Singleton pattern to ensure a single instance of the logger
- Configurable through the central configuration file
- Supports both console output and file logging
- Implements conditional logging based on the configured log level
- Provides methods for each log level (debug, info, warn, error)
- Formats log messages with appropriate color coding

### 5. Usage:
The Log System can be easily integrated into various parts of the server code, allowing for consistent and centralized logging across the entire application.

## III. Database
- The database consists of multiple json files stored in the following directories as defined in the external configuration file (`config.js`):

  - `PLAYER_DATA_PATH = './source code/world data/players';`
  - `LOCATIONS_DATA_PATH = './source code/world data/locations';`
  - `NPCS_DATA_PATH = './source code/world data/npcs';`
  - `ITEMS_DATA_PATH = './source code/world data/items';`
  - `GAME_DATA_PATH = './source code/world data/game data.json';`

### 1. Game Data Manager
- The `GameDataManager` class is responsible for loading, parsing, checking, and storing data from these files.
  - Loads location data, parses it, checks for duplicate IDs and logs an error if any are found, then stores it in the `locations` collection as `Map` objects.
  - Utilizes the `LocationCoordinateManager` class, which is responsible for assigning (x,y,z) coordinates to locations.
  - Loads NPC data, parses it, checks for duplicate IDs and logs an error if any are found, then stores it in the `npcs` collection as `Map` objects.
  - Loads item data, parses it, checks for duplicate IDs and logs an error if any are found, generates a unique ID for each item using the `generateUID()` method, then stores it in the `items` collection as `Map` objects.
  - Stores game-related data in the `gameData` object.
