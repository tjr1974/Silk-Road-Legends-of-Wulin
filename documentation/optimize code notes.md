# OPTIMIZE CODE

## Comments
Concerning code, details and precise terminology are very important. Ensure every class and method has a clear and concise comment that accurately explains its intended functionality.

## Use Named Constants
Replace magic numbers and strings with named constants. This improves readability and maintainability. For example, define constants for paths, statuses, and other repeated values.

## Batch Database Operations
When loading or saving data, consider batching operations to minimize the number of I/O calls. For example, load all player data in one call instead of multiple calls for each player.

## Use Efficient Data Structures
For collections of entities (like players, npcs, items.), consider using Sets or Maps for faster lookups and insertions compared to arrays.

## Asynchronous Code
Ensure that all async functions are awaited where necessary. Check for unhandled promise rejections.

## Avoid Unnecessary Async/Await
If a function does not need to be asynchronous, avoid using async/await to reduce overhead.

## Optimize Game Loop
In the game loop, ensure that only necessary updates are performed. For example, only update npcs or players that have changed state.

## Memory Management
Regularly clean up unused objects or references to prevent memory leaks, especially in long-running processes.

# REDUCE CODE

## Refactor Repeated Logic
Identify repeated code blocks and extract them into utility methods.

## Combine Similar Methods
If methods have similar logic, consider combining them into a single method with parameters to handle variations.

## Use Inheritance
For classes like Item, WeaponItem, and ContainerItem, if they share common properties or methods, consider creating a base class.

## Simplify Conditionals
Use early returns to reduce nesting in conditional statements for all methods.

## Use Array Methods
Utilize array methods like map, filter, and reduce to simplify loops wherever appropriate.

## Encapsulate Logic
Group related methods into classes to encapsulate functionality and reduce the number of global functions.

## Remove Unused Code
Regularly review and remove any unused variables, methods, or classes.
- Identify variables that are declared but never used.
- Identify methods that are defined but never called.
- Identify classes that are defined but never instantiated.

## Design Patterns
Implement design patterns (like the Factory or Strategy pattern) where applicable to streamline object creation and behavior.

### Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This is useful when the creation process is complex or when the exact type of the object isn't known until runtime.

### Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. It is particularly useful for situations where multiple algorithms can be applied to a problem.

# MODULES

## Module Existence
Check that all modules being imported actually exist in the specified paths. If a module is missing, it will cause runtime errors.

## File Paths
Verify that the paths used in import statements are correct relative to file structure. Adjust paths as necessary.

## Import Statements
Ensure all import statements are correctly referencing the paths and modules.

## Optimize Imports
Ensure that only necessary modules are imported, and consider using a single import statement for related modules.

## Exporting Functions/Classes
Ensure that all necessary functions or classes are exported from their respective modules.

## Export Statements
Use named exports or default exports appropriately for multiple exports in a file.

## Static Properties
Ensure that static properties in classes are correctly referenced and that CONFIG is imported correctly and contains the expected structure. Be cautious of circular dependencies, as they can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Testing Imports
Add logger debug messages in each module to ensure they are being loaded correctly.

# CLIENT

## Debounce or Throttle Events
For frequently triggered events (like combat actions), implement debouncing or throttling to limit how often they can be processed.
