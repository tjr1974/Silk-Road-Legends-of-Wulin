**Silk Road: Legends of Wulin** is based on historical China and the famous Silk Road trade routes. Designed to profoundly immerse players in ancient civilizations of the Far East, it provides players an opportunity to experience the thrill of exploring a new, mysterious, and often dangerously deadly world. Players create unique custom characters, complete quests, fight enemies, obtain pets, and more. There are no restrictive fixed classes or professions on the Silk Road. All players can freely undertake any task at will.

The Silk Road itself is a vast cultural and economic network of ancient trade routes connecting China with Egypt and Rome. Many types of travelers journey along the Silk Road. While some desire only adventure, others prefer fortune and glory.

- Legendary warriors wander the land keeping the peace, protecting the weak, and righting wrongs.
- Merchants risk their wealth and lives in search of spectacular profits.

- Professional escorts and bodyguards are determined to protect merchant caravans from would-be marauders.
- Slave traders are always seeking new buyers and new sources of product.
- Warlords compete for dominance, superiority, and power.
- Soldiers battle to protect frontier territories and keep the countryside safe from untold threats.
- Mercenaries and assassins offer their skill to the highest bidder.
- Others are mere travelers, pilgrims, priests, and monks, each possessing their own inscrutable agenda.

The Silk Road is open to you! Will you seek profit through trade and the challenges that it brings? Will you relieve greedy merchants of their burdensome wealth? Will you be a lone-wolf exploring the vast wilderness? Will you take an active role as a guardian to protect others or safeguard peace throughout the realm?
