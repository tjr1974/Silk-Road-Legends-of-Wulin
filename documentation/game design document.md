## General Game Concept
Silk Road: Legends of Wulin is based on historical China and the famous Silk Road trade routes. Designed to profoundly immerse players in ancient civilizations of the Far East, it provides players an opportunity to experience the thrill of exploring a new, mysterious, and often dangerously deadly world. Players create unique custom characters, complete quests, fight enemies, obtain pets, and more. There are no restrictive fixed classes or professions on the Silk Road. All players can freely undertake any task at will.

The Silk Road, itself, is a vast cultural and economic network of ancient trade routes connecting China with Egypt and Rome. Many types of travelers journey along the Silk Road. While some desire only adventure, others prefer fortune and glory.

Legendary warriors wander the land keeping the peace, protecting the weak, and righting wrongs. Merchants risk their wealth and lives in search of spectacular profits. Thieves and bandits intend to liberate entire caravans of their riches. Professional escorts and bodyguards are determined to protect merchant caravans from would be marauders. Slave traders are always seeking new buyers and new sources of product. Warlords compete for dominance, superiority, and power. Soldiers battle to protect frontier territories and keep the countryside safe from untold threats. Mercenaries and assassins offer their skill to the the highest bidder. Others are mere travelers, pilgrims, priests, and monks. Each of whom possess their own inscrutable agenda.

The Silk Road is open to you! Will you seek profit through trade and the challenges that it brings? Will you relieve greedy merchants of their burdensome wealth? Will you be a lone-wolf exploring the vast wilderness? Will you take an active role as a guardian to protect others or safeguard peace throughout the realm? Will you assume the mantle of a legendary hero or an infamous villain? Is there any genuine difference between heroes and villains? Only you can decide.

Experience the ancient world of martial arts, as you never have before. Seize your trusted weapon and join your martial brothers. It's time to become a LEGEND!

## Common Wuxia Tropes

### Insurgency
Many best-selling Wuxia novels are set in the Qing Dynasty, and to a lesser extent, the Yuan and Southern Song Dynasty. As is well-known, these were the centuries when China was under threat, or already conquered and ruled by foreign powers. Wuxia stories set in these periods thus often feature martial artists gathering to resist invasion or to overthrow occupying forces. Many of the genre's most beloved characters also hail from such works.

### Legendary Weapons or Skills
With kung fu being the heart of Wuxia, many stories naturally involve quests or competitions for legendary weapons (兵器 bing qi) and skills. In the case of the latter, it is usually some forbidden manual (秘笈 mi ji) that records exotic or lost kung fu techniques. To repeat, legendary weapons in Wuxia do not possess magical properties too. They are typically coveted for their finesse or are themselves keys to larger treasures.

### Wulin Dominance
Wulin (武林), or Jianghu (江湖), is the world of Chinese martial artists. It encompasses all clans and sects, unaffiliated individuals, as well as the interactions between these characters and factions. Wuxia novels centered on Wulin thus frequently feature one clan or individual rising to power through sheer pugilistic superiority or ruthless machinations. The bulk of the story is then about the struggle to overthrow this tyrant. Typically, with the "main hero" mastering some form of superior technique.

### Vengeance
The trope of vengeance is heavily used in Wuxia stories. Usually, it involves a conflicted individual seeking revenge for the murder of his clan or sect. Or it could be the quest to redeem one's honor after a mortifying defeat.

### Wulin Intrigue
Outside of insurgencies, inter-faction struggles, and so on, many Wuxia stories also examine the intricate relationships between larger-than-life characters. Common sub-themes include love, rivalry, greed, the burden of family name, and other human conflicts.
