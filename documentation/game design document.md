**Silk Road: Legends of Wǔlín** is based on historical China and the famous Silk Road trade routes. Designed to profoundly immerse players in ancient civilizations of the Far East, it provides players an opportunity to experience the thrill of exploring a new, mysterious, and often dangerously deadly world. Players create unique custom characters, complete quests, fight enemies, obtain pets, and more. There are no restrictive fixed classes or professions on the Silk Road. All players can freely undertake any task at will.

The Silk Road, itself, is a vast cultural and economic network of ancient trade routes connecting China with Egypt and Rome. Many types of travelers journey along the Silk Road. While some desire only adventure, others prefer fortune and glory.

- Legendary warriors wander the land keeping the peace, protecting the weak, and righting wrongs.
- Merchants risk their wealth and lives in search of spectacular profits.
- Thieves and bandits intend to liberate entire caravans of their riches.
- Professional escorts and bodyguards are determined to protect merchant caravans from would-be marauders.
- Slave traders are always seeking new buyers and new sources of product.
- Warlords compete for dominance, superiority, and power.
- Soldiers battle to protect frontier territories and keep the countryside safe from untold threats.
- Mercenaries and assassins offer their skill to the highest bidder.
- Others are mere travelers, pilgrims, priests, and monks, each possessing their own inscrutable agenda.

The Silk Road is open to you! Will you seek profit through trade and the challenges that it brings? Will you relieve greedy merchants of their burdensome wealth? Will you be a lone-wolf exploring the vast wilderness? Will you take an active role as a guardian to protect others or safeguard peace throughout the realm? Will you assume the mantle of a legendary hero or an infamous villain? Is there any genuine difference between heroes and villains? Only you can decide.

Experience the ancient world of martial arts, as you never have before. Seize your trusted weapon and join your martial brothers. It's time to become a **LEGEND**!

#### Wǔlín Intrigue
   - Complex relationships and conflicts between characters and factions

### Common Wǔxiá Tropes

#### Insurgency
   - Wǔxiá stories are frequently set during the Míng and Qīng Dynasty (清朝) periods, and to a lesser extent, the Yuán (元朝) and Southern Sòng Dynasty (南宋). As is well-known, these were the centuries when China was under threat, or already conquered and ruled by foreign powers. Wǔxiá stories set in these periods thus often feature martial artists gathering to resist invasion or to overthrow occupying forces.

#### Legendary Weapons or Skills
   - With Gōngfu being the heart of Wǔxiá, many stories naturally involve quests or competitions for legendary weapons (兵器 bīngqì) and skills. In the case of the latter, it is usually some forbidden manual (秘笈 mìjí) that records exotic or lost Gōngfu techniques. To repeat, legendary weapons in Wǔxiá do not possess magical properties too. They are typically coveted for their finesse or are themselves keys to greater treasures.

#### Wǔlín Dominance
   - Wǔlín (武林), or Jiānghú (江湖), is the world of Chinese martial artists. It encompasses all clans and sects, unaffiliated individuals, as well as the interactions between these characters and factions. Wǔxiá novels centered on Wǔlín thus frequently feature one clan or individual rising to power through sheer pugilistic superiority or ruthless machinations. The bulk of the story is then about the struggle to overthrow this tyrant. Typically, with the "main hero" mastering some form of superior technique.

#### Vengeance
   - The trope of vengeance is heavily used in Wǔxiá stories. Usually, it involves a conflicted individual seeking revenge for the murder of his clan or sect. Or it could be the quest to redeem one's honor after a mortifying defeat.

#### Wǔlín Intrigue
   - Outside of insurgencies, inter-faction struggles, and so on, many Wǔxiá stories also examine the intricate relationships between larger-than-life characters. Common sub-themes include love, rivalry, greed, the burden of family name, and other human conflicts.
