# Queue Module Overview

The Queue module is used by the `QueueManager` class. It manages a queue of tasks that need to be executed, ensuring that tasks are processed in a controlled manner. Here are the key features:

1. **Task Management**: It allows adding tasks to a queue and processes them sequentially.
2. **Object Pooling**: It uses an `ObjectPool` to manage reusable `Task` objects, optimizing memory usage and performance.
3. **Task Execution**: The `processQueue` method handles the execution of tasks, ensuring that only one task is processed at a time to prevent re-entrance.
4. **Task Types**: It supports various task types, such as data loading, saving, combat actions, event processing, health regeneration, inventory management, and notifications.
5. **Cleanup Method**: It includes a cleanup method to reset the queue and task pool, allowing for a fresh start when needed.

Overall, the `QueueManager` class is designed to efficiently handle and execute tasks in a game server environment.

## Why use a QueueManager?

1. **Efficient Task Management**: It ensures that tasks are processed in a controlled and sequential manner, preventing task overlap and potential conflicts.
2. **Resource Optimization**: By utilizing an `ObjectPool` for `Task` objects, it reduces memory overhead and improves performance, especially in environments with high task frequency.
3. **Scalability**: The ability to handle various task types allows the server to scale and adapt to different gameplay mechanics without significant code changes.
4. **Controlled Execution**: The `processQueue` method ensures that only one task is executed at a time, which is crucial for maintaining game state integrity and preventing race conditions.
5. **Flexibility**: The cleanup method allows for easy resetting of the queue and task pool, making it simple to manage game state transitions or restarts.
6. **Improved Maintainability**: Encapsulating task management within a dedicated class promotes cleaner code and easier maintenance, as changes to task handling can be made in one place.

Overall, the `QueueManager` enhances the reliability, performance, and maintainability of your game server, contributing to a smoother gaming experience.

## Here are some guidelines for determining what tasks should be handled by a queue and what should not:

### Tasks Suitable for a Queue
1. **Asynchronous Operations**: Tasks that involve I/O operations (e.g., file reading/writing, network requests) should be queued to avoid blocking the main execution thread.
2. **Long-Running Tasks**: Any task that may take a significant amount of time to complete (e.g., data processing, complex calculations) should be queued to ensure responsiveness.
3. **Rate-Limited Actions**: Tasks that need to be executed at a controlled rate (e.g., API calls, game events) should be queued to prevent overwhelming resources.
4. **Background Processing**: Tasks that can be processed in the background without immediate user feedback (e.g., saving game state, loading assets) are ideal for a queue.
5. **Task Dependencies**: If a task depends on the completion of another task, it should be queued to ensure proper execution order.
6. **Batch Processing**: Tasks that can be grouped together for efficiency (e.g., bulk data updates) should be queued to optimize performance.

### Tasks Not Suitable for a Queue
1. **Immediate User Feedback**: Tasks that require instant feedback or interaction (e.g., UI updates, user input handling) should not be queued, as they need to be processed immediately.
2. **Short, Simple Tasks**: Tasks that are quick to execute and do not involve significant processing (e.g., simple calculations) may not need to be queued, as they can be handled directly.
3. **Real-Time Actions**: Tasks that require real-time processing (e.g., player movements, combat actions) should be executed immediately to maintain game state integrity.
4. **Critical Path Operations**: Any task that is essential for the immediate functioning of the application (e.g., initializing core components) should not be queued, as it may lead to delays.
5. **Synchronous Operations**: Tasks that must be executed in a synchronous manner (e.g., certain database transactions) should not be queued, as they require immediate execution.

### Summary
In general, use a queue for tasks that can be deferred, require asynchronous processing, or need to be managed in a controlled manner. Avoid queuing tasks that require immediate execution, user interaction, or are critical to the application's core functionality.
