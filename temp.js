### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Initialization**:
   The `GameDataLoader` class is instantiated, which includes a reference to the `DatabaseManager` that handles data loading.
2. **Loading Location Data**:
   The `fetchGameData` method in `GameDataLoader` is called.
   Inside this method, `loadLocationData` from `DatabaseManager` is invoked to load the location data.
3. **Reading Files**:
   The `loadLocationData` method:
   - Retrieves the file path for location data from the configuration.
   - Reads all JSON files in the specified directory.
   - Parses the JSON data and ensures it is in the correct format (an array).
   - Collects all location data into an array.
4. **Returning Data**:
   The method returns the loaded location data along with the filename of the first file read.
5. **Assigning Coordinates**:
   After loading the location data, the `assignCoordinates` method of `LocationManager` is called to set up the coordinates for each location based on the loaded data.
6. **Verifying Game Data**:
   The `GameDataVerifier` class is instantiated, which takes the `DatabaseManager` as a parameter.
   The `validateGameData` method is called, which:
   - Calls `loadLocationData` again to retrieve the location data.
   - Calls `loadNpcData` and `loadItemData` to load NPC and item data, respectively.
   - Collects all loaded data into a single object for verification.
7. **Logging and Displaying Data**:
   The loaded data is logged for debugging purposes.
   The `displayLocationsWithCoordinates` method is called to print out the details of each location, including its coordinates.
8. **Error Handling**:
   Throughout the process, error handling is implemented to log any issues encountered during data loading or verification.
### Summary
The `loadLocationData` method is responsible for fetching and parsing location data from files, while the `GameDataVerifier` ensures that all game data, including locations, NPCs, and items, is loaded correctly and can be verified for integrity. This process is crucial for setting up the game environment before gameplay begins.
